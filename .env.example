# PgBouncer Connection Pooling (Optional but Recommended)
# Enable PgBouncer for better connection management and performance
# When enabled, the API will connect through PgBouncer (port 6432) instead of directly to PostgreSQL
DB_PGBOUNCER_ENABLED=false            # Set to 'true' to enable PgBouncer pooling
DB_PGBOUNCER_PORT=6432                # PgBouncer listens on this port

# Benefits of enabling PgBouncer:
# - Handle 1000s of client connections with fewer PostgreSQL connections
# - Transaction pooling mode (one connection per transaction, not per session)
# - Better performance for web applications and serverless functions
# - Automatic connection multiplexing and reuse

# This should be the external domain/IP that clients use to connect
